Linux installation in DoubleCommander:
1. Install the adb.wfx plugin
2. Delete the adb.wfx file and rename adb_rename.wfx to adb.wfx
(The reason is a bug in the FPC compiler with shared libraries vs LCL forms)
If the plugin does not work check "ldd adb.wfx" and make sure all shared libraries can be found.
If not provide the ones from Ubuntu 16.04 x64
