Version 0.8.1 [2019-06-07]
[+]  Added \remote subdir containing scripts and other files that can
     help enable remote service management. See new section 5
     "Remote service management" in Readme file.
[*]  Updated Readme to include a whole new section about Remote service
     management and the caveats that come with it.
[+]  Plugin now shows service DLL in service properties dialog, F3 function
     and custom columns
[+]  Added new placeholder {SvcDll} for internal/external tools
[*]  Fixed: Plugin wasn't able to work with services with a colon in their
     name, despite it returned them as such to TC.
     Now every special character except backslash should work.
[*]  Service properties dialog, Advanced tab: Plugin checks for the
     validity of the specified account first and now shows correct error
     message if it's invalid.
[+]  Service properties dialog, Advanced tab: Added checkbox that shows if
     a service runs under virtual/managed service account (Win7 and higher)
[*]  Fixed: Plugin wasn't able to set any properties of services that used
     virtual accounts or managed service accounts (e.g. MSSQL server
     services). Sorry for the inconvenience.
[+]  Added new option DisablePanelAutoRefresh to [Services2] section. See
     Readme and/or Services2.sample.ini for details.
[*]  Improved number of keyboard shortcuts available to internal and
     external tools significantly by supporting ENTER, UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT
     and many more. See Readme for details.
[+]  Added configuration for keyboard shortcuts for internal tools, allowing
     to override/disable the F3 key that was hardcoded so far. See Readme
     for details on the new shortcut options.
[*]  Expanded default custom columns view to include service name and PID
[*]  Changed/corrected processorArchitecture in plugin manifest
[*]  Some smaller bug fixes, code cleanup and optimization
[*]  Updated Danish translation, thanks to petermad!
[+]  Added Polish translation, thanks to dmocha!

Version 0.8.0 [2016-12-05]
[!]  No public release!
[+]  Added service PID to service properties dialog, F3 function and
     custom columns
[*]  Fixed: plugin was not able to start services that depend on service
     groups (e.g. apcupsd). Sorry for the inconvenience.

Version 0.7.1 [2015-12-18]
[*]  Fixed a potential buffer overflow in FsContentGetValue interface
     function
[*]  Return FS_FILE_EXISTS in FsGetFile so TC can ask the user whether
     to overwrite existing files
[*]  Sanitize filenames in FsGetFile, i.e. replace illegal/special characters,
     so that all files can be copied to the local file-system

Version 0.7.0 [2015-11-20]
[+]  Added option Monitor to [Services2] section. See Readme for details
[*]  Fixed an error that caused the plugin to open the wrong service from
     TC's search window, especially when services on different (remote)
     computers were found. Note that this bugfix required a rewrite of
     a small portion of the plugin's code - which might have introduced
     new bugs; please report any bugs, errors and so on.
[+]  Plugin settings dialog: The translator's name (or more precisely
     the contents of the Translator key) of every language file will now
     be shown next to the language file name

Version 0.6.2 [2015-11-08]
[!]  No public release!
[*]  Return icons to TC in requested size. Previously, the plugin's internal
     icons were always large, all others were small.
[*]  Fixed wrong placement of dialogs on multi-monitor systems.
     Previously the dialogs were placed on the primary monitor, now they
     will be placed on the active monitor (the one TC is displayed on)

Version 0.6.1 [2015-06-21]
[+]  Service properties dialog, Advanced tab: Added button to launch MMC
     snap-in (services.msc) with either local or remote system. This is
     an option that allows to edit service properties this plugin doesn't
     provide (e.g. Recovery).
[+]  Try harder to find service executables by searching for them in
     directories specified in %PATH% to be able to show file details in TC
     panel. That even works for "unusual" command lines like
     "system32\VBoxService.exe".
[*]  Plugin settings dialog: Repositioned two of the checkboxes that were
     moved by mistake in v0.6.0
[*]  Updated Danish translation, thanks to petermad!
[*]  Updated Russian translation, thanks to Alexander Gvaramiya (Nero Wolfe)!
[*]  Updated Italian translation, thanks to squeeze69!
[*]  Updated Chinese translation, thanks to SunX!
[*]  Updated Hungarian translation, thanks to Bluestar!
[*]  Updated Dutch translation, thanks to Jaap Kramer!
[*]  Smaller changes and optimization

Version 0.6.0 [2015-04-25]
[+]  Added remote computer management. Please note that this feature has some
     limitations, see section "Limitations" in Readme for details.
[*]  Fixed: Delayed autostart couldn't be set on some services. The plugin now
     behaves like the MMC snap-in (services.msc) which means that you may see
     a warning if delayed autostart couldn't be set (error 87)
[*]  Made options available in settings dialog:
     AddSvcNameToDependencyTrees and ShowIcons (section Services2.Tools)
[*]  Fixed a memory leak regarding icons
[*]  Fixed an access violation when a service without an executable was deleted
     in TC's panel
[+]  Added: Pressing Shift+Enter on a service now opens the path of the service
     executable in a new tab and sets the cursor on the executable (TC 8.0+)
[+]  Added feature to rename services directly in TC's panel. Note: this is
     limited to the display name and will be ignored if service names instead of
     display names are shown in TC's panel
[*]  Internal code cleanup and optimization

Version 0.5.1 [2015-03-20]
[!]  No public release!
[*]  Updated Danish translation, thanks to petermad!
[+]  Added option to show service name instead of display name in TC's panel

Version 0.5.0 [2015-03-18]
[+]  Added support for internal and external tools, accessible via a button in the
     service properties dialog. It allows to
     - view the executable's properties (like Alt+Enter)
     - view the executable in TC's lister
     - open the default browser to search for the service name or its executable name
     - open any user-defined external tool with the service executable
     This feature is really helpful to examine unknown services and their executables,
     especially in conjunction with TC Lister plugins like FileInfo and PEViewer, and
     external analysis tools like anti-virus scanners, hex editors, debuggers and so
     on. See Readme for a detailed description.
[+]  Added a lot more custom columns to show information about the service executables,
     e.g. Copyright, Company name, File version and so on.
[+]  Added experimental support for WOW64 services, and a new checkbox to service
     properties dialog to show whether a service is a WOW64 service (see FAQ section in
     the Readme)
[*]  Changed the default button of the plugin's delete confirmation dialog (called by
     service properties dialog) to "No" to avoid the accidental deletion of services.
     Please note that plugins can't change the default button in TC's delete confirmation
     dialog, which is shown when a file is deleted in TC's file list!
[*]  Reduced the plugin size by ~10% by using different linker/compiler settings
[*]  Service properties dialog: Reduced the update interval of the progress bar to 200ms
[+]  Service properties dialog, Dependency page: Added service names to the dependency
     trees (can be disabled with the new option AddSvcNameToDependencyTrees, see below)
[+]  Added some new options (not available in settings dialog)
     See Services2.sample.ini for their description
     - AddSvcNameToDependencyTrees
     - ShowIcons (section Services2.Tools)
     - AutoDetectArch (section Services2.Tools)
[+]  Plugin settings dialog: Added a button to open plugin settings file in editor that is
     set in TC, so users can edit it directly without the need to navigate to it by hand
[*]  All ANSI functions are now returning an error when called. Previously they were just
     returning the same as the Unicode functions
[*]  Renamed Services2.ini.sample to Services2.sample.ini so that syntax highlighting works
     in editors that support it
[*]  Rewritten the Readme in HTML format to allow better formatting
[*]  Some internal optimizations

Version 0.4.3 [2014-10-04]
[!]  No public release!
[+]  Added Dutch translation, thanks to Jaap Kramer!
[*]  Some more exception handling to avoid certain crashes. This should increase
     stability, and it additionally fixes a definite crash on the Windows 10 Tech Preview
[+]  Added a note to the service properties dialog that is shown if there was an error
     while querying the service config
[*]  Changed manifest to include compatibility with Win8, Win8.1 and Win10. Not that it
     helps much as TC plugins depend on TC's manifest...

Version 0.4.2  [2014-07-25]
[+]  Added Chinese translation, thanks to SunX!
[+]  Added Russian translation, thanks to Alexander Gvaramiya (Nero Wolfe)!
[+]  Added translation_instructions.txt which contains some instructions
     for translators. I hope the pluginst.inf and Services2.lng files are
     not forgotten that often anymore ;)
[*]  (Hopefully) Fixed the issue that the icon of a service didn't reflect
     its real state when the option "Show service state in the extension
     column of TC's panel" was disabled
[*]  Service properties dialog, Advanced page:
     Repositioned the controls and made some of them wider to allow longer
     strings for translations
[*]  Fixed: Restart service function (in the service properties dialog)
     didn't show confirmation dialog to stop dependent services
[*]  Changed "file download": string padding is now based on the longest
     (translated) string in the whole "file" instead of a fixed value of
     20 characters. I hope this is better for translations.
[+]  Added a new option (not available in settings dialog)
     AddTxtExtensionOnDownload, see Services2.ini.sample for explanation
[*]  Some internal optimizations

Version 0.4.1  [2014-04-21]
[+]  Added Hungarian translation, thanks to Bluestar!
[+]  Added Danish translation, thanks to petermad!
[+]  Added Italian translation, thanks to squeeze69!
[*]  Made the settings dialog and plugin properties dialog wider to allow
     longer strings for translations
[*]  Return icon state strings in FsExtractCustomIcon properly to allow TC
     to cache them only once per state (should decrease memory consumption)
