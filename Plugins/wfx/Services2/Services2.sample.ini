[Services2.Tools]
;--- ShowIcons=1
;    Show icons in the list of external tools
;ShowIcons=0

;--- AutoDetectArch=1
;    Automatically determine the architecture of all external tools.
;    This adds some comfort to external tools management without having

;    cause slowdowns by anti-virus software and the like.
;    If this feature is disabled, the architecture of all external tools must be
;    set in Services2.Tools section (see description of x64 key in readme.txt)
;AutoDetectArch=0
