Version 1.10
------------
ADDED     Added support for .. items
FIXED     High dpi mode e.g. 120pi or 144 dpi should look just fine. 
CHANGED   The way hotkeys are handled has been changed as the plugin could not be started when another plugin was displayed and user pressed 4. However it's unfortunately not a full fix as you have to press 4 twice in some cases. This includes opening the Lister not using the keyboard and then cycle through plugins by pressing 4.
ADDED     The current path is now displayed in a new area above the file list.     
ADDED     The number of files in a folder is now displayed next to the size. This cannot be configured at the moment. A setting will be added later.
ADDED     Pressing delete moves an item to the recycle bin. If moving to bin isn't possible the item will be deleted. A confirmation dialog is displayed in all cases.
ADDED     It's now possible to navigate folders inside the plugin by pressing return or performing a doubleclick to go down or by pressing backspace to go up.
