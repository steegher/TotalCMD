About F4Menu
--------------------------
As the name implies, F4Menu pops up a context menu upon pressing F4,
the user then chooses an appropriate editor for the selected file.
Certainly, it is also possible to run F4Menu in the background
without showing the menu and automatically open a file with its
associated editors.

However, from v0.50 F4Menu is no longer restricted to F4, it support
to customize the shortcut key.
F4Menu can be launched by any application, particularly it's suitable
for using as F4 Editor for Total Commander.

F4 is the shortcut key of Total Commander/TC for opening and editing
files, it invokes the specified editor to open the selected file.
Unfortunately, in TC only one editor can be assigned to F4, so it is
impossible to choose other editors for different file types, or to
select different editors for one specified file type. F4Menu is the
right tool to solve these problems.

Features
--------------------------
1. Press a single key and choose the best suited editor to open your
   file.
   
2. Use different editors to open different files at the same time.

3. Press a single key to open files with default editor.

4. Selection menu supports drag-and-drop for easy reordering of items.

5. Easy to use and configure to meet your most challenging demands.

      TC Configuration -> Options -> Edit/View -> Editor for F4
    Then press F4 on a file in TC.

2. Run Mode

  2.1 Default open mode
    Open files with default editor directly.
    By default, press F1 to run F4Menu in this way. It can be changed by

       "*.xxx", that means there are several files with the same
       extension. Choose this item to open the files with the system
       associated program. This item is shown in grey if no program
       is associated.
    b. The second menu item is the default editor, which is used to
       open all unassociated files in background mode.

Installation
--------------------------
1. Download F4Menu.zip (39kB, Unicode) from http://www.shannycn.com

2. System requirements: Windows NT/2000/XP/2003/Vista/2008,
   Total Commander 7.0 or above.

3. Unzip F4Menu to any folder.

4. If using F4Menu with Total Commander, please refer to "How to use 1.2"

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------
1. Is it possible to associate an editor with empty extension, such as
   "Makefile"?

A: Yes, just leave the extension field empty, for example, "txt,,"
   associates with "txt" and empty extension.

2. In the settings dialog, I removed the first line of editors, but the
   following lines did not go up, is it a bug of F4Menu?

A: No. The first line is the default editor, if the default editor is
   removed, this line will be empty, but F4Menu does not promote the
   next editor to be default. You can also drag-and-drop to sort 
   editors in the list.

3. Can F4Menu run VBScript or JScript?

A: Yes, just set wscript.exe as the editor and the script as parameter.

4. I selected several files in an archive, but F4Menu only opened one,
   is this a bug?

A: No. Actually, TC cannot open files in archive directly, it must
   unpack the files to a temporary folder before opening them.
   TC only unpacks the file under cursor instead of all selected files,
   so F4Menu can only open the one TC has unpacked.

5. Inside an archive, a "User abort!" message is shown while pressing
   ESC+F4 to launch F4Menu, why?

A: As mentioned in question 4, TC unpacks the file before opening it,
   during this time, ESC key may be treated as a command to abort,
   this triggers the message in question. In this case, you can use
   another shortcut key: CapsLock+F4 (depends on setting).

6. Is it possible to remove the default editor?

A: Sure, you can drag & drop it down the list or remove it in both
   the pop-up menu and the setting dialog box.

7. How to use F4Menu in any other software?
A: Actually pressing F4 in TC just launch the specified editor F4Menu, 
and use the filename under cursor as its parameter.
It's the same for any other programs, just need launch F4Menu with filename 
or filelist as parameter, only may not use F4 as shortcut key.
For example, in Directory Opus, can create a new toolbar button, add 
{allfilepath} as its parameter, and assign any key as hotkey.
In windows explorer, it cannot call external programs, but we can associate files
to F4Menu, then press Enter to open the file can launch F4Menu and popup the
select menu.
Certainly, F4Menu also can be used in non-file manager software, for instance,
it can be used as source editor of IE or Firefox, then view HTML source in them 
will launch F4Menu to select.

8. How to customize the shortcut key?
A: First we need to set the shortcut key for launching F4Menu in TC or other
apps, please refer FAQ7 for more details.
For example in TC, by default F4 and Win+F4 can launch the F4 editor - F4Menu,
if we need other shortcut key such as F1 in F4Menu setting, we need assign F1
as a shortcut key to launch F4Menu in TC:
TC Configuration -> Misc -> Hotkey -> Select F1 -> Set command as cm_Edit
Then in F4Menu setting, we can set F1 as the shortcut key for default open mode,
F4 for foreground mode, and any other shortcut key such as Win+F4 for background
mode.

9. How to use the shortcut key ESC+F4/F4 as before?
A: Some users are used to the old shortcut key ESC+F4/F4, actually the new
version still supports it:
Just need to set 'ESC' as the shortcut key of foreground/background mode, then
pressing ESC+F4/F4 can launch F4menu in different mode.
